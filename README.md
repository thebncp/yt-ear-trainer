I made this to help me practice identify song keys by ear as well as practice improvisation. It allows you to load youtube videos from a playlist (select an option or import your own playlist to shuffle). 

Most backing tracks uploaded to youtube include the key in the title of the video as well as in the video itself, along with the recommended scales to use. In order to make it harder to see this information, the defaut embed of the youtube video is of a smaller size than normal, and the titles are hidden. Youtube does not allow full obfuscation of video visuals, so while some information is still visible if you look for it, this seemed to be the best way to make it difficult to discern the key and scales visually before figuring them out by ear. 

To check if you were correct as well as to see the full youtube title and get a link to the video hosted on youtube, you can toggle strict mode on and off which will make the embed full size and reveal the video title. You can also see a list of video titles in the sidebar if you so choose.

I plan to add additional playlist options in the future, and the current playlists will continue to be added to.
